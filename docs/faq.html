  Should I use The Grinder 2 or The Grinder 3?
      </h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>The Grinder 3. The Grinder 3 has many enhancements over The Grinder 2.
  The Grinder 3 is in active development.</p>
<p>If you continue to use The Grinder 2, be aware that it has
  defects (including <a href="#premature-eof">this one</a> and <a href="#extra-line">this one</a>) that will not be fixed.</p>
<p>Here is a partial list of changes.</p>
<ul>
      
<li>Test scripts are now written in a dynamic scripting
      language, either using Jython or Clojure. String beans and OK
      strings have been removed from the HTTP plug-in. String beans
      and OK strings are very limited in comparison to to the
      flexibility now provided.</li>

      
<li>Many <a href="guide/properties.html">grinder.properties</a>
      have been removed. The features formerly accessed through
      setting properties are now set by making calls to the plug-in
      from test scripts. Some of the remaining property names have
      been renamed.</li>

      
<li>The TCPSniffer has been renamed <em>TCPProxy</em> for
      correctness. The TCPProxy can be used with other HTTP and HTTPS
      proxies. Many new features and fixes have been added to the
      TCPProxy.</li>

      
<li>Console signals are now transmitted over a TCP socket
      connection. Multicast is no longer used, removing a frequent
      source of setup problems.</li>

      
<li>The interface that plug-ins must implement has changed
      completely. Plug-ins written for The Grinder 2 will not work
      with The Grinder 3. The JUnit and Socket plug-ins have been
      removed. Their functionality can be achieved directly by using
      the appropriate Java objects in scripts. It is rarely necessary
      to write a plug-in for The Grinder 3.</li>

      
<li>HTTP tests can now be directed through an HTTP proxy.</li>

      
<li>The <span class="codefrag">HttpURLConnection</span> implementation has been
      removed from the HTTP plug-in.</li>

      
<li>Many other updates to HTTP testing functionality.</li>

      
<li>HTTPS and SSL contexts can now be controlled on a per thread
      basis.</li>

      
<li>From the console you can edit test scripts and distribute them to
      the worker processes. It is no longer be necessary to copy
      grinder.properties files around or to use a shared disk.</li>

      
<li>The console can be controlled through a REST API.</li>

<h4 class="faq">1.1.3. 
  How does The Grinder stack up against a commercial tool like
  Mercury Interactive's LoadRunner&trade;?
      </h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>Here is an edited version of <a href="mailto:tom.braverman.at.bea.com">Tom Braverman</a>'s post
    to <a href="mailto:grinder-use.at.lists.sourceforge.net">grinder-use</a>.</p>
<dl>
        
<dt></dt>
  
<dd class="quote"> A few reasons:

    <ul>
      
<li>The Grinder is lightweight

        <p>Compared to setting up LoadRunner or some other full
        featured tools, The Grinder is trivial to install and
        get running.</p>
      
</li>

      
<li>The Grinder is a <em>programmer's load tester</em>

        
<p>Too often, programmers defer load testing to some
        other group (e.g., QA) and don't test their own
        components for scalability. The Grinder is designed for
        people who understand the code that they're hitting -
        it's not just a "black box" with a set of associated
        response times.</p>

        
<p>Since tests can be coded - and not simply scripted,
        programmers get to test interior tiers of their
        application and not just response time via the user
        interface.</p>
      
</li>

      
<li>The Grinder is free

        <p>I'm a consulting professional and I have to come up
        with solutions to deadlocks and slow downs. Sometimes I
        only have hours to recreate a problem and then attempt
        to resolve it. I can't count on my client having a given
        load testing tool and many (most?) development teams
        don't have any such tool (they defer this type of
        testing to QA as mentioned above). I can bring The
        Grinder in and set it up and apply load quite
        quickly.</p>
      
</li>
    
</ul>

    
<p>Summarizing: I don't try and persuade my clients that The
    Grinder is a replacement for LoadRunner, etc. I tell them
    that The Grinder is for use by the developers and that
    they'll still want the QA team to generate scalability
    metrics using LoadRunner or some other tool approved for the
    purpose by management.</p>

    
<p>Story: One client was attempting to determine scalability
    based on LoadRunner. The LoadRunner team - with no
    understanding at all of the app - was telling them that some
    pages were giving response times of 30 seconds. The project
    manager knew this was patent BS since he could hit the enter
    key on his page and only count to 3 or 4 before the page
    displayed. The client spent many resource days attempting to
    understand LoadRunner numbers. Within a few hours, The
    Grinder was up and running and reporting numbers that
    appeared to track with the user experience. The Grinder
    became the gold standard that the client used to measure
    LoadRunner.</p>
    
</dd>
  
</dl>
<p>Its worth adding to this that many companies <em>are</em>
  using The Grinder for production load testing.</p>

<a name="threads-vs-processes"></a>
<h4 class="faq">1.2.1. 
        How do I control the number of simulated users?
      </h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>Typically a worker thread is thought of as a client context
  which can simulate a concurrent user. You can control the
  number of worker processes per agent and the number of threads
  per process. You shouldn't need to run more than one agent
  process per machine. The number of simulated users is then</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">
number of worker threads x number of worker processes x number test machines
  </pre>
</div>
<p>To simulate additional users it is usually better to
  increase the number of worker threads rather than the number
  of processes except where:</p>
<ul>
    
<li>Your JVM threading implementation is particularly
    inefficient. This is not such a problem nowadays. Running
    several hundred threads per process is usually fine.</li>

    
<li>The protocol you are using will behave differently when
    distributed across multiple processes. For example, the
    WebLogic Server t3 protocol is optimised so that a single
    TCP/IP connection is used between any two processes.</li>
  
</ul>
</div>
<a name="multiple-scripts"></a>
<h4 class="faq">1.2.2. 
  Can I run different test scripts against the same console?
      </h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The console receives reports and updates the graph based on
  test number. Thus it is possible to have different agent
  processes running scripts with different test numbers (e.g.
  one process running tests 1 to 5 and another running tests 6
  to 10)., reporting to the same console.</p>
</div>
<a name="testrun-period"></a>
<h4 class="faq">1.2.3. 
  How do I run the tests for a specific period of time?
      </h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>Use the console to control the test. If you want the tests
  to run for an hour and your sample interval is set to 5
  seconds, set the console to collect 720 samples.</p>
<p>If you're not using the console, see <a href="guide/properties.html">grinder.duration</a>.</p>

      </h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>No. The Grinder only measures the response of the test
  server as a black box. Look to other tools such as
  <span class="codefrag">sar</span> and <span class="codefrag">vmstat</span> to measure server CPU
  utilisation.</p>

<h3 class="underlined_5">1.3. Statistics</h3>

<h4 class="faq">1.3.1. 
  Where is the raw data stored?

<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>Liam Morley asked:</p>
<p class="quote">I understand that all the information from
  the workers is sent back to the client, but all I see thus far
  is rough statistical data which seems to have been compiled
  from the raw data. When the data is sent back to the console,
  where is it stored?</p>
<p>For efficiency, the worker processes only send back
  aggregate information to the console, not the raw data. Each
  worker process sends the console a report every 500ms. The
  report contains information for each test that was invoked
  during the period which includes the number of invocations,
  the total time taken, the number of errors, and any other
  custom statistics.</p>
<p>Each worker process writes out the raw information to a
  process specific data file. This are the <em>data_...</em>
  files that are stored with the other log files.</p>
<p>Apart from the raw data, another advantage that these files
  give you that the console doesn't is a record of the testing
  time line. Whilst the console graphs present this information
  graphically, the console only allows you to save snapshots of
  the current statistics.</p>
</div>
<a name="calculation"></a>
<h4 class="faq">1.3.2. 
  How does the Grinder calculate the mean time and TPS?
      </h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>Each worker process records the time taken by each thread
  for each test and regularly reports the mean time for each
  test to the console. The console calculates the mean time for
  each test across all worker processes. This is the <em>mean
  time</em>.</p>
<p>Tests per second (TPS) is calculated by the console. It is
  the sum of the number of tests performed by all worker
  processes within the sampling period, divided by the duration
  of the sampling period. Using longer sampling periods will
  give better averages, but the console display will be updated
  less frequently.</p>
</div>
<a name="norelation"></a>
<h4 class="faq">1.3.3. 
  What is the relation between mean time and TPS?
      </h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>In general there is not a linear relationship between the
  test time and the number of tests per second.</p>
<p>Most time in a typical server-side application is spent
  waiting on I/O. Elapsed time is not the sum the time spent by
  all of the threads. If I have a simple servlet or EJB that
  does the following:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: java">
void doit() {
  Thread.sleep(1000); // 1 second
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>Say with this I get 100 TPS and a 1.2 second response time.
  If I now change the code to:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: java">
void doit() {
  Thread.sleep(10000); // 10 seconds
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>the system isn't doing any more work and I'd expect to get
  100 TPS and a 10.2 second response time.</p>

<p>Dennis Linnell wondered this. This is what he found
  out:</p>
<dl>
          
<dt></dt>
    
<dd class="quote">
      
<p>A network protocol trace revealed that the differences
      in POST vs. GET times were attributable to the following:</p>

      
<ol>
        
<li>The Grinder (HTTPClient) sends a GET request as a
        single TCP protocol data unit (PDU), which requires a
        single acknowledgement (ACK). This is normal and
        expected.</li>

        
<li>HTTPClient sends a POST as two PDUs: The first
        includes everything but the Name/Value pairs and
        requires an ACK; the second includes only the Name/Value
        pairs and also requires an ACK. This is a consequence of
        the conservative implementation of HTTP/1.1 pipelining
        in HTTPClient.</li>

        
<li>When the first PDU of the POST arrives at the
        Windows XP TCP/IP protocol stack on the server, the
        <em>delayed ACK</em> feature of TCP/IP RFC 1122 kicks
        in. If another request were to arrive, the stack would
        send an ACK; otherwise it waits up to 200 ms. and then
        sends an ACK. Since, in this case, no other request
        arrives, <a class="external" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/328890/">the
        stack delays the ACK</a>. Naturally, I made the changes
        outlined in the Microsoft knowledge base and it solved
        the problem for me. Case closed? Maybe not.</li>

        
<li>Still, the question remains, <em>Is the HTTPClient
        behavior reasonable?</em>. I traced Microsoft Internet
        Explorer 6 (latest patch level) and it sends a POST in
        one PDU and thus does not invoke the dreaded <em>delayed
        ACK</em>. On the other hand, Firefox 1.0.4 (oddly)
        requires 3 pairs of PDUs to get the job done. So
        HTTPClient is somewhere in between.</li>

        
<li>As HTTPClient's behavior is not in violation of the
        HTTP/1.1 RFC, I have no reason to complain. And, looking
        at the HTTPClient code, I'm certainly not bold enough to
        touch it. Still, it doesn't quite model the behavior of
        the market-leading web browser accurately.</li>

<p>How your web application behaves under non-trivial load and how long it

<p>The Grinder runs through test script elements sequentially while browsers,

        using parallel threads. The number of parallel threads depends on the browser type,
        MS Internet Explorer typically uses 3. Therefore the browser should complete requesting

<p>In some load situations, on some hardware, older Linux

      running the stock Red Hat Linux 7.0 kernel (2.2.16).</p>

      
<p>The Grinder occasionally reported negative response
      times in the -900 to -700 ms range whenever the load
      became high. Interestingly, the same OS + kernel version
      on several other machines never showed these negative

      specific: a C program polling gettimeofday() also showed
      system time jumping backwards.</p>

      
<p>Upgrading to kernel 2.2.19 fixed this issue for me.
      Since the release notes for Linux 2.2.18 mention time

  What can I do about address in use exceptions on
  Microsoft Windows machines?
      </h4>
<div align="right">

<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>Answer courtesy of Venkat:</p>
<dl>
          
<dt></dt>
    
<dd class="quote">
      
<p>Recently, there have been a couple posts from people
      facing the <em>address in use</em> exception when running
      The Grinder. I also faced the same issue and here is what
      I found and how I resolved it.</p>

      
<p>Windows OS TCP-IP system has a parameter that controls
      the maximum port number used when an application requests
      any available user port from the system. By default,
      ephemeral (that is, short-lived) ports are allocated
      between the values of 1024 and 5000 inclusive. During a
      Grinder test, if we exceed this limit, we get the
      <em>address in use</em> exception. To make it more
      complicated, there is another parameter that says once the
      application closes a TCP connection, how long the OS will
      wait before reclaiming the port for the connection. The
      default value for this is 4 minutes.</p>

      
<p>Due to the above, often the default Windows
      configuration isn't sufficient to run load tests. To change
      this, modify the following Registry values under the key
      <span class="codefrag">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters</span>:</p>


<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">
MaxUserPort       = dword:00004e20 (20,000 decimal)
TcpTimedWaitDelay = dword:0000001e (30 decimal)
</pre>
</div>

      
<p>The above was sufficient for my testing. Adjust the
      <span class="codefrag">MaxUserPort</span> to a larger number if you still
      run into the exception. Of course, the OS needs to be
      rebooted once the setting is changed. MS documentation
      says the <span class="codefrag">MaxUserPort</span> setting is available
      since Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 5. I am not sure which
      version introduced the <span class="codefrag">TcpTimedWaitDelayed</span>
      setting. You can confirm whether your OS version supports
      this by looking into the Registry location above.</p>

<h4 class="faq">1.5.6. What are the limits to accurate timing?</h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>The Grinder records test times for each successful test. By
    default, this is done by a section of code that looks like:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: java">
context.startTimer(); // Critical section starts

try {
    // do test
}
finally {
    context.stopTimer();  // Critical section ends
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>This is repeated for each test.</p>
<p>If there are many threads within the worker process, (and the
    sleep time is small or the test takes a long time or the test
    performs I/O), it is <em>highly</em> likely that the JVM will swap
    the thread out in the critical section causing an erroneously large
    test time to be reported.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the load injector machine that you are running The Grinder
    on is also running other active processes (such as other worker
    processes), it is <em>highly</em> likely that the operating system will swap
    the process out in the critical section, again causing an erroneously
    large test time to be reported. If The Grinder is co-hosted with the
    target server, and the plug-in uses a synchronous protocol, (e.g.
    the HTTP plug-in), such swapping is a <em>certainty</em>.</p>
<p>Further, as the CPU utilisation rises, the contention on the
    critical section rises non-linearly and in a way that is difficult
    to quantify. The recorded time becomes more a measure of how efficiently
    the OS and JVM can swap between multiple threads and less a measure of
    server performance.</p>
<p>
<em>This is a generic problem with all test harnesses and is not
    limited to The Grinder or Java</em>. Within the scope of a single
    machine there is little that can be done about this whilst
    realistically using multiple threads and processes.</p>
<strong>Fiddling with Thread scheduling - a partial fix</strong>
<p>From The Grinder 2.6.1, the call to <span class="codefrag">startTimer</span>
    makes a <span class="codefrag">Thread.yield()</span> call before recording the
    start time which means that a thread is more likely to be swapped
    out/in just before the critical sections. It dramatically reduced
    the response times I measured (e.g. 30 ms to 3 ms). I consider
    this only an approximate fix to the problem - it does not prevent
    the OS from swapping the process out.</p>
<p>The recorded response time should always be considered an upper
    bound on the actual response time. Doing the <span class="codefrag">yield()</span>
    makes that bound more accurate.</p>
<p>An argument against doing this is that it slightly alters the
    statistical distribution of the client invocations. I'd counter
    that without the <span class="codefrag">yield()</span> the distribution is not
    even; its down to the OS and JVM scheduling so threads/processes
    are far likely to be swapped at some points (e.g. waiting on I/O)
    than others. Because of this I decided there is little point in
    making the <span class="codefrag">yield()</span> optional.</p>
<strong>The <em>Timer Client</em> model - a solution?</strong>
<p>One solution to this problem is to dedicate a single machine to
    the measuring of response times. I call this the "timer client"
    model.</p>
<p>As of The Grinder 2.6.1 you can set a property (<a href="g2/properties.html">grinder.recordTime</a> for
    The Grinder 2, renamed to
    <a href="guide/properties.html">grinder.reportTimesToConsole</a>
    for The Grinder 3) to be
    <span class="codefrag">false</span> which will cause the worker processes that use
    that <span class="codefrag">grinder.properties</span> file not report the test
    times to the console. You should run all but one
    of your worker processes with this property set to
    <span class="codefrag">false</span>. These are the <em>load clients</em>.</p>
<p>You should copy the grinder.properties file to a dedicated
    <em>timer client</em> machine, change the
    <span class="codefrag">grinder.recordTime</span>/<span class="codefrag">grinder.reportTimesToConsole</span>
    property to be <span class="codefrag">true</span>, and set <a href="guide/properties.html">grinder.processes</a> and <a href="guide/properties.html">grinder.threads</a> to <span class="codefrag">1</span>.
    The single worker process will run on the timing client, record
    all timing information and (optionally) report it to the console.
    The less other stuff you run on the timing client, the better.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this method is that the statistical sample
    of the test times is much smaller.</p>
<strong>An update after some experimentation</strong>
<p>Testing has shown that the difference the timer client model
    makes is only measurable when those clients are co-hosted with the
    server. When you have separate server and client machines its
    better to not use the timer client model because it decreases the
    sample size of test times.</p>
<p>I recommend trying both models. If you discover something
    interesting, please report it to <a href="mailto:grinder-use.at.lists.sourceforge.net">grinder-use</a>.</p>

      How do I take a thread dump?
      </h4>
<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>A thread dump is a diagnostic report of the state of a Java process. If
      you report an unresponsive grinder process to one of the mailing lists, you
      most likely will be asked to take a thread dump. This answer explains how
      to do that.
      </p>
<p>First identify the relevant <a href="guide/getting-started.html#The+Grinder+processes">process</a>,
      and start it from a command line terminal. The output will go to the
      command line, so either set the terminal up so that it has plenty of lines
      of scroll-back or redirect the output of the process to a file. For
      example, you might start an agent process with:
      </p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
C:\&gt; java net.grinder.Grinder &gt; output.txt
</pre>
</div>
<p>If you are using a UNIX-like operating system, taking the thread dump
      is simple. Just use <span class="codefrag">ps</span> to identify the process id, then issue
      a <span class="codefrag">kill -3 &lt;pid&gt;</span> to send the process a
      <span class="codefrag">SIGQUIT</span> signal. You will find the thread dump in the
      terminal window (or the file to which you redirected output).</p>
<p>On Windows, use one of the following:</p>
<ul>
        
<li>If it is an <em>agent</em> or <em>console</em> process you are
        interested in (not a <em>worker</em> process), type <span class="codefrag">Ctrl-Break</span>
        in the command line terminal.</li>

        
<li>If it is a worker process, things are a little more involved. This is
      because worker processes are children of agent processes, and Java does
      not pass on <span class="codefrag">Ctrl-Break</span> signals to child processes.
      You can work around this problem by running the
      <a href="#grinder-debug">workers and
      the agent in the same process</a>, then using <span class="codefrag">Ctrl-Break</span>
      as above.
        </li>
      
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the JVM's <span class="codefrag">jstack</span>
      command. The alternative to <span class="codefrag">jstack</span> for the Oracle
      JRockit JVM is the powerful <span class="codefrag">jrcmd</span> command.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the regular expression must be dynamically generated

<p class="quote">Is there a way (with Grinder 3) to make that
  my requests depends on the response?</p>
<p>Absolutely. This is one of the compelling reasons to use
  The Grinder 3 over The Grinder 2.</p>
<p class="quote">I will make an example. Supose that when I
  make a request the server gives me one list of, for example,
  cars, and I want to edit the information of one, but I don't
  know its ID, so I have to look into the response and look for
  it. Can I do that?</p>
<p>I'm assuming HTTP and that the cars come back in a table
  such as</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">
&lt;td&gt;Jaguar&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1234&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bentley&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0012&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rolls Royce&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8323&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rover&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9876&lt;/td&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>You can get the text of the HTTP response body with
  something like:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: python">
response = myrequest.GET("/carindex.html")
text = response.text
</pre>
</div>
<p>See the <a href="./guide/script-javadoc/index.html">script API</a> for other
  things you can do with the <span class="codefrag">HTTPResponse</span> object.</p>
<p>Now you have the choice of using Java or Python to extract
  the appropriate ID. Lets do it in Python. Rather than write
  low level string parsing, we'll use a regular expression for
  capturing interesting information.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are faster if compiled, so we'll do
  this up front:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: python">
# Add to top of script
import re
expression = re.compile(r"&lt;td&gt;([\w\s]*)&lt;/td&gt;\s*&lt;td&gt;(\d*)&lt;/td&gt;")
</pre>
</div>
<p>For eyes unused to magic of regular expressions, this one
  matches pairs of table cells, the first cell containing
  alphanumerics and white space, the second containing a number.
  <span class="codefrag">\w</span> matches an alphanumeric ("word") character,
  <span class="codefrag">\s</span> matches a white space character,
  <span class="codefrag">()</span> captures its contents in a group.</p>
<p>We can then use the regular expression to parse the
  response:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: python">
response = myrequest.GET("/carindex.html")

for car, id in expression.findall(response.text):
    print car, id
</pre>
</div>
<p>Of course you want to use this to select an ID and use it
  in a subsequent page. Lets pick a random one and use it for a
  new request:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: python">
response = myrequest.GET("/carindex.html")

# Import random for this to work.
car,id = random.choice(expression.findall(response.text))

request = myrequest.GET("/viewcar?id=%d" % id)

  rarely affect server behaviour. Its worth knowing how to
  examine the differences with the TCPProxy. First <a href="guide/tcpproxy.html">set the TCPProxy as a browser
  proxy</a> and record the output to a file. Secondly alter your
  tests so that all requests go via the TCPProxy (the best way
  is to set the test script connections to direct requests via
  the TCPProxy acting an HTTP proxy); again record the output to
  a file. Now grab a coffee and compare.</p>

       This is due to a mismatch of the SSL configuration of the server
       and that of the JDK you use to run The Grinder; most likely a clash
       between domestic and export strength key lengths. You should probably
       install the <a class="external" href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">

      How do I record a script for a server that uses SSL?

<div align="right">
<a href="#">^</a>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<p>By default, the TCPProxy will use a built-in certificate to handle
      SSL traffic so you don't need to do anything extra, just record a script as normal.</p>
<p>Should you encounter problems with this, especially when using Internet Explorer to
      connect through the TCPProxy, you will need to provide a server certificate for The Grinder.
      The easiest way to provide a server certificate is to copy the <em>testkeys</em> file
      from the JSSE samples distribution and start the proxy using:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
  java net.grinder.TCPProxy -keyStore testkeys -keyStorePassword passphrase
</pre>
</div>
<p>You can specify your own keystore containing relevant client and
      root certificates. Tell the TCPProxy to use the keystore and ssl
      by using the following parameters when invoking the TCPProxy:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
  -keystore <em>(keystore)</em> -keystorepassword <em>(password)</em> -keystoretype <em>(type)</em>

</pre>
</div>
<p>Should you encounter further problems with your SSL connection you can
      turn on debug by using the following switch:</p>
<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
  -Djavax.net.debug=ssl

<p>The totals line only includes data from basic tests,
        i.e. tests that do not include other tests. It does not
        include the data from composite tests, i.e. tests that include
        other tests, such as those those instrumenting pages in HTTP
        scripts generated by the TCPProxy. The time taken by these
        page tests is typically quite long since it also includes
        sleep time and can easily exceed the average time for basic
        tests.</p>
<p>Composite test lines in the Results tab have a grey background to
        emphasise that they are different.</p>
<p>This is done so that the totals line is meaningful, useful,
        and understandable. If data from composite tests were included
        in the totals line, some of the values (e.g. average test
        time) would be meaningless since time would be accounted for
        twice, once by the basic request tests, and once by the page
        test that instrumented the requests.</p>
<p>Data from composite tests is also not included in the totals line
        in the worker process log files.</p>

<p>You must set up multicast if you want to use the console
  with The Grinder 2. It is used to send signals from the
  Console to the Grinder processes (start, stop). Multicast is
  no longer necessary for The Grinder 3.</p>
<p>Multicast addresses lie in the range <span class="codefrag">224.0.0.0</span>

  <span class="codefrag">0</span> to <span class="codefrag">65535</span>. You should ensure that
  the address and ports you chose does not clash with other
  applications running on your LAN. The example files uses the

<p>For most modern TCP stacks, e.g Windows 95/98/NT, Linux,
  multicast works out of the box.</p>

<div class="shcontainer">

route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0

<p class="quote">I have been looking for a solution for this

<p>I now use a slightly cheaper/lighter solution; namely I

<p>I didn't really see this in the docs anywhere so if
      anyone is interested. I needed dynamic post data and the
      HTTP plugin post parameter only took a file name. The key
      was that the file can optionally contain a reference to a
      <a href="g2/http-plugin.html#string-bean">String Bean</a>
      method. I tried it on a fluke and it worked.</p>


<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">
grinder.test0.parameter.url=&lt;getLoginUrl&gt;
grinder.test0.parameter.post=getPostData.dat
</pre>
</div>
      
<p>
<span class="codefrag">getPostData.dat</span> has one line in it:</p>


<div class="shcontainer">
<pre class="brush: text; gutter: false;">
&lt;getPostData&gt;
</pre>
</div>

      
<p>This tells The Grinder to call my String Bean method
      which returns my dynamic POST content based on the test
      description. I'm pretty pleased with that.</p>
