    <p>Requests for help should be sent to <a

    to a list before you can send email to it</strong>. The email address you
    send mail from must be the one you used to subscribe.

    <p><a
    href="{{ site.data.links.mail.grinder-announce.href }}">grinder-announce@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
    is a low-volume mailing list which is used to announce new
    releases and other items of interest to users of The Grinder.</p>

    <p>Please <a href="development/contributing.html">contribute bug fixes and
    enhancements</a> to <a
    href="{{ site.data.links.mail.grinder-development.href }}">grinder-development@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

    <p>You can <a href="{{ site.data.links.sourceforge.grinder-mail.href }}">subscribe
    and unsubscribe</a> to the lists, and search their archives, through <a
    href="{{ site.data.links.sourceforge.grinder.href }}">SourceForge.net</a>. <a

    <p>When Philip Aston finds the time to respond to mail about The
    Grinder, <strong>messages not copied to one of the above mail lists
    are likely to be ignored</strong>. Philip freely copies responses to the
    lists; if there is a particular reason why you want to keep your
    communication private you must say so. Finally, if you can provide answers
    to questions sent to the lists, please don't be shy!</p>

    <note>The Grinder is free software. No one is under any obligation
    to fix your problem. If all else fails, you have the
