<h1>The Grinder Web Console</h1>

  <p>Since the version 4.0.0, The grinder comes with a Web Console by default.
  This webconsole is reachable at the following default location <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:6373">http://localhost:6373</a>
  The Web Console leverage the same webserver already used for the <a href="console-service.html">console service</a>, thus it is possible to change the Web Console port
  Just like you used to change the console service port.
  </p>

    <h2>Process controls</h2>

    <p>The <em>Start/Stop processes</em>, <em>Reset statistics</em>, and <em>Start
    Embedded Agent</em> menu items send signals to Grinder processes that are
    listening. (See the <a
    href="properties.html">properties</a>
    <code>grinder.useConsole</code>, <code>grinder.consoleHost</code>
    and <code>consolePort</code>.) <em>Start processes</em> and
    <em>Reset processes</em> are also tool bar buttons. </p>

    <img src="../images/webconsole-process-control.png" width="258" alt="Start Processes and Reset Processes toolbar buttons"/>

    <p>The start processes button switch to a stop processes button when the processes are actually started.
    You can check whether any agents are connected on the
    <a href="#Agents+tab">Agents tab</a>.</p>

    <img src="../images/webconsole-process-control-stop.png" width="258" alt="Start Processes and Reset Processes toolbar buttons"/>

    <p>Worker processes that are controlled by the console can be in one of
    three states:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Initiated (waiting for a console signal)</li>

      <li>Running (performing tests, reporting to console)</li>

      <li>Finished (waiting for a console signal)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The <em>Start processes</em> control signals to worker
    processes that they should move into the running state. Processes
    that are already running will ignore this signal. Processes that are in
    the finished state exit; the agent process will then reread the
    properties file, and launch new worker processes in the running
    state.</p>

    <p>The <em>Stop processes</em> control signals all the worker
    processes to exit. The agent process will then reread the
    properties file and launch new worker processes.</p>

    <p>The <em>Reset statistics</em> control simply set to zero all the
    statistics data recording by the grinder.</p>

    <p>The <em>Start embedded agent</em> control is a new feature of the
    Grinder 4.0.0. It aims to start an agent within the Grinder Console 
    Java VM. This way it becomes easy to deploy a Console/Single Agent
    Grinder topology</p>

    <note>Each time the worker processes run, they generate a new
    set of logs. Logs from previous runs are "archived" by renaming
    them. The number of logs that are kept from previous runs can be
    controlled with <code> grinder.numberOfOldLogs</code>.</note>

    <h2>The Reporting tab</h2>

    <p>The Reporting tab shows  graphs in relation with the results from The Grinder instrumentation.</p>

    <img src="../images/webconsole-graph.png" width="700" alt="Start Processes and Reset Processes toolbar buttons"/>

    <p>There is three different graphs, reprensenting the evolution of the following metrics over the last hour:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>TPS - The Transaction per seconds</li>
      <li>Mean Test Time</li>
      </li>Standard Deviation</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Each graph displays (at maximum) the last hour of the relative metrics,
      with a sample period or 5 seconds. This scale is not modifiable for the
      moment. If you reset the statistics using the Reset statistics button or the 
      <a href="console-service.html">console service</a> API, it also resets the graphs</p>

    <section>

      <h2>Local Logs tab</h2>

      <p>This tab displays list the files in the logs generated in the local <code>grinder.logDirectory</code> folder
      It is useful to read the logs generated by the agents started on the same box of the Console</p>


      <p>There is three buttons on this tab, there is a Refresh button that you can use to make sure the list
      of files currenly displayed is the one present in the folder. There is a Clear All button that erase all the
      content of the log folder. Then there is a Download button that aims to download the file currenlty displayed</p>

      <note>Only the 50000 last lines of the log file are displayed when you click on a flie in the Log Files list</note>

    </section>

    <section>

      <h2>Editor tab</h2>

      <p>This tab contains the console support for script editing.</p>

      <p>To use the file distribution, follow these steps:</p>

      <ol>
       <li><a href="#setdirectory">Set the directory for the script distribution</a></li>
       <li><a href="#createscript">Create a script and a property file</a></li>
       <li><a href="#selectproperties">Select the properties file to use</a></li>
       <li><a href="#startworkers">Start the Worker processes</a></li>
      </ol>

      <section id="setdirectory">
       <h2>Set the directory for the script distribution</h2>

       <p>The file tree on the left hand side of Script tab is shows the a view
       of local files on the console machine. Use
       the <strong>Set Distribution folder</strong> button to set the distribution directory to the place
       where you want to store your scripts. All of the files below the directory will be
       distributed to the worker processes, so don't set it to <em>/home</em> or <em>C:\</em>.
       </p>

       <p>If you are using The Grinder for the first time, you might like to set
       the distribution directory to the <code>examples</code> directory in
       The Grinder installation.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="createscript">
       <h2>Create a script and a property file</h2>

       <p>You can use the console to create, view, and edit script files in the
       distribution directory. The editor is rudimentary, but good enough for
       basic editing.</p>

       <p>If your script relies on other files (including Jython modules), copy
       them below the distribution directory.</p>

       <p>Once you have your script ready, create a
       <a href="properties.html">properties</a> file.
       The file name extension should be <code>properties</code>, and unless you have many
       different properties files in the directory, the file is usually called
       <code>grinder.properties</code>. If your script is not called <code>grinder.py</code>,
       add a <code>grinder.script</code> property to your properties file:</p>
       <code>grinder.script = myscript.py</code>
       <p></p>
       <p>
       The properties sent from the console are combined with any set
       in a <code>grinder.properties</code> file in the agent's working directory
       or <a href="properties.html#commandline">set
       on the agent command line</a>. If a property is specified in several
       places, the order of precedence is</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Properties sent by the console<em>[most important]</em></li>
       <li>Properties set on the agent command line</li>
       <li>Properties in the agent's local <code>grinder.properties</code> file <em>[least important]</em></li>
       </ul>

       <note>If your agents are running remotely to the
       console, you will need to set the <code>grinder.consoleHost</code> property
       (and <code>grinder.consolePort</code> if the console isn't using the
       default port) in the agent's command line or local
       <code>grinder.properties</code> so it can make the initial connection
       to the console.
       </note>
