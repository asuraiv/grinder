  <h2>About Instrumentation</h2>

  <p>The Grinder allows a script to mark the parts of the script code
  that should be recorded. This is called <em>instrumentation</em>.
  </p>

  <p>Code is instrumented for a <a href="scripts.html#tests">Test</a>.
  When instrumented code is called, the test's statistics are updated.
  The standard statistics record the time taken, number of calls, and number
  of errors. Advanced scripts can add additional
  <a href="statistics.html">custom statistics</a>.</p>

    <p>We've seen an example of using instrumentation in the <a
    href="scripts.html#tests">introduction</a>.  To recap, you
    instrument an object by using a <code>Test</code> to modify the
    Java byte code of the object.  Here's the example code again.</p>

<pre class="jython">
from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.script.Grinder import grinder
 
test1 = Test(1, "Log method")
 
# Instrument the info() method with our Test.
test1.record(grinder.logger.info)
 
class TestRunner:
    def __call__(self):
        log("Hello World")
</pre>

    <p>Each time "Hello World" is written to the log file, the time taken
    will be recorded by The Grinder.</p>


  <p>Instrumentation can be <em>nested</em>. For example, you might
  instrument a method with Test 1, and the method code might call two
  <code>HTTPRequest</code>s that are instrumented with Test 2 and Test
  3. The code instrumented by Tests 2 and 3 is nested within the Test
  1 code. The time recorded against the Test 1 will be greater than
  the total time recorded for Tests 2 and 3. It will also include any
  time spent in the function itself, for example calls to
  <code>grinder.sleep()</code>.</p>

      <h2>Supported targets</h2>

      <p>A wider range of target objects can be instrumented.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
        <td>Java instance</td>
        <td>Each call to a non-static method is recorded, including
        calls to super classes methods. Instances of arrays and
        primitive types cannot be instrumented.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Java class</td>
        <td>Each call made to a constructor or a static method declared by
        the class is recorded. Calls of non-static methods or static methods
        defined by super classes are not recorded.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Jython instance</td>
        <td>Each call to an instance method is recorded.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Jython function or method</td>
        <td>Each call of the function or method is recorded.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Jython class</td>
        <td>Each call made to the Jython class (i.e. constructor calls) is
        recorded.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Clojure function</td>
        <td>Each call of the function is recorded.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>JVM classes loaded in the bootstrap classloader, and classes
      from The Grinder's <code>net.grinder.engine.process</code>
      implementation package cannot be instrumented.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Selective instrumentation</h2>

      <p>The Grinder 3.7 adds an overloaded version of <a
      href="{{ site.data.links.grinder.g3.api.Test.record-filter.href }}">record</a> that allows the
      target object to be instrumented selectively.</p>

      <p>Selective instrumentation is useful for instrumenting
      instances of the <a href="{{ site.data.links.grinder.g3.api.HTTPRequest.href }}">HTTPRequest</a>
      class, which has ancillary methods that typically need to be
      called without affecting test statistics. Here's an example of
      how to use selective instrumentation.
      </p>

<pre class="jython">
from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.plugin.http import HTTPRequest
 
test = Test(1, "my test")
 
class GetAndPostFilter(Test.InstrumentationFilter):
  def matches(self, method):
    return method.name in ["GET", "POST"]
 
request = HTTPRequest(url="http://grinder.sourceforge.net")
test.record(request, GetAndPostFilter())
 
class TestRunner:
    def __call__(self):
        # GET() is instrumented, so call statistics are reported.
        request.GET()
 
        # getUrl() is not instrumented, no call statistics are reported.
        print "Called %s" % request.url
</pre>

    <h2>Troubleshooting Instrumentation</h2>

    <p>The instrumentation relises on Dynamic Code Redefinition, a
    Java 6 feature.</p>

    <p>When you start an agent process, you will normally see a line
    like this in the <a href="getting-started.html#output">worker
    process log file</a>.</p>

    <pre class="text">
    16/11/09 08:02:18 (process paston01-0): instrumentation agents:
    byte code transforming instrumenter for Jython 2.1/2.2; byte code transforming instrumenter for Java</pre>

    <p>If you see the following line, you should check you are using a
    Java 6 JVM.</p>

      <pre class="text">
