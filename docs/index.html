    <h1>The Grinder, a Java Load Testing Framework</h1>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What is The Grinder?</h2>

    <p>The Grinder is a Java<sup>TM</sup> load testing framework that makes it
    easy to run a distributed test using many load injector machines. It
    is freely available under a BSD-style open-source <a
    href="license.html">license</a>.</p>

  <h2>Key features</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Generic Approach</strong> Load test anything that has a Java API. This
    includes common cases such as HTTP web servers, SOAP and REST web services,
    and application servers (CORBA, RMI, JMS, EJBs), as well as custom
    protocols.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible Scripting</strong> Test scripts are written in the powerful <a href="{{ site.data.links.jython.href }}">Jython</a> and  <a href="{{ site.data.links.clojure.href }}">Clojure</a>
    languages.</li>
    <li><strong>Web based graphical interface</strong> Since grinder 4.0.0, a native
      web console is provided by the Grinder. It helps user ot manage the Grinder
      Infrastructure through the HTTP protocol.</li>
    <li><strong>Distributed Framework</strong> A graphical console allows multiple
      load injectors to be monitored and controlled, and provides centralised script editing
      and distribution.</li>
    <li><strong>Mature HTTP Support</strong> Automatic management of client
      connections and cookies. SSL. Proxy aware. Connection throttling.
      Sophisticated record and replay of the interaction between a browser and
      a web site.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Dynamic Scripting</h2>

    <p>Test scripts are written using a dynamic scripting language,
    and specify the tests to run. The default script language is <a
    href="{{ site.data.links.jython.href }}">Jython</a>, a Java implementation of the popular
    Python language.</p>

    <p>The script languages provide the following capabilities:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Test any Java code</strong></dt>

      <dd><p>The Grinder 3 allows any code (Java, Jython, or Clojure)
      code to be encapsulated as a test. Java libraries available for
      an enormous variety of systems and protocols, and they can all
      be exercised using The Grinder.</p></dd>

      <dt><strong>Dynamic test scripting</strong></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>The Grinder 2 worker processes execute tests sequentially
        in a fixed order, and there is limited support in some of the
        The Grinder 2 plug-ins for checking test results. The Grinder
        3 allows arbitrary branching and looping and makes test
        results directly available to the test script, allowing
        different test paths to be taken depending on the outcome of
        each test.</p>

        <p>The Grinder 2 HTTP plug-in's string bean
        feature provides simple support for requests that contain
        dynamic data. The Grinder 3 can use the full power of Jython
        or Clojure to create dynamic requests of arbitrary
        complexity.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>The powerful scripting removes the need to write custom
    plug-ins that extend The Grinder engine. Although plug-ins are no
    longer responsible for performing tests, they can still be useful
    to manage objects that the tests use. For example, the standard
    HTTP plug-in manages a pool of connections for each worker thread,
    and provides an <code>HTTPRequest</code> object that makes use of
    these connections.</p>

    <p>Kind of dry, huh? If you never seen any Python, take a look at
    the <a href="guide/script-gallery.html">Script Gallery</a> in the user
    manual where you can sample the power of The Grinder 3.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The Grinder was originally developed for the book
    <em>Professional Java 2 Enterprise Edition with BEA WebLogic
    Server</em> by Paco G&#xf3;mez and Peter Zadrozny. Philip Aston
    took ownership of the code, reworked it to create The Grinder 2,
    and shortly after began work on The Grinder 3. The Grinder 3
    provides many new features, the most significant of which is
    dynamic test scripting.  Philip continues to enhance and maintain
    The Grinder.</p>

    <p>In 2003, Peter, Philip
    and Ted Osborne published the book <a href="links.html#book">
    J2EE Performance Testing</a> which makes extensive use of The Grinder 2.
    </p>

    <p>Support for <a href="links.html#clojure">Clojure</a> as an alternative
    script language was introduced in 3.6.</p>

    <p>In 2018, Cyril and Olivier, users of the Grinder for several years,
    have decided to fork the Grinder and provide a Graphical interface to
    proposes a new experience on using the Grinder. The Grinder 4.0 was born.</p>
